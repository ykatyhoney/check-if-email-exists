# Understanding "is\_reachable"

## `is_reachable`?

Reacher provides a confidence score for how likely an email is to be delivered. This score is shown in the `is_reachable` field and can have four values:

* **`safe`**: This email is very likely to be delivered (bounce rate below 2%). Some bounces may still rarely occur due to IP blacklisting.
* **`invalid`**: This email will almost certainly not be delivered.
* **`risky`**: The email exists but may have problems that could cause issues like bounces or low engagement. These could be:
  * A temporary (disposable) email
  * A shared account (e.g., support@ or admin@)
  * A catch-all address (accepts all emails for a domain)
  * A full inbox
* **`unknown`**: Sometimes, the email provider blocks our real-time verification, so we canâ€™t determine deliverability. If you encounter this, let me know by email at amaury@reacher.email. I'm constantly working on ways to fix these issues case-by-case.
