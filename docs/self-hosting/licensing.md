  Commercial License?

# Licensing

## Yes, Reacher is Open-Source

Reacher is proudly open-source and distributed under the [**AGPL-3.0 license**](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) (GNU Affero General Public License). This license ensures that Reacher’s source code is freely available, and any modifications or improvements made to the code must also be shared under the same license.

However, companies **cannot use** the open-source version if they plan to integrate Reacher into **proprietary software** or services without sharing their modifications. The AGPL-3.0 requires that if you offer the software as part of a web service, you must make your code (including any modifications) publicly available. For more details, check [GNU’s AGPL-3.0 guide](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

## Commercial License required for Proprietary applications

The Commercial License allows companies to integrate Reacher into their proprietary software or services without being bound by the open-source license terms (such as making their own code publicly available). By obtaining a Commercial License, businesses can use Reacher with full control over how the software is implemented and distributed within their products.

Check Reacher's [pricing page](https://reacher.email/pricing) to buy a Commercial License.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both the open-source and Commercial License give you access to the same Reacher software.

## Does Reacher offer a Free Trial?

Yes, Reacher offers a **free trial** that allows you to use the self-hosted software for a limited time. During this period, you can test Reacher’s features for **internal testing** and **non-commercial purposes**. However, the trial is not intended for full-scale production use or commercial applications. To begin your trial, please contact [amaury@reacher.email](https://app.gitbook.com/u/F1LnsqPFtfUEGlcILLswbbp5cgk2 "mention"), and you can then follow the guide to [install.md](install.md "mention").
