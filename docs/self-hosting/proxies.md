# Proxies

## What is a SOCKS5 Proxy?

A **SOCKS5 proxy** is a flexible proxy protocol that supports various types of traffic, including SMTP. When using it for email verifications, the reputation of the **proxyâ€™s IP** is what matters, not your own IP. The proxy handles requests on your behalf, which helps protect your actual IP while ensuring verifications go through successfully. This is crucial for maintaining deliverability and avoiding issues like blacklisting.

## Verify an Email Using a Proxy

Reacher's API allows making an email verification using a proxy. Send a request with the following fields:

```json
{
    "to_email": "someone@gmail.com",
    "proxy": {                        // (optional) SOCK5 proxy to run the verification through, default is empty
        "host": "my-proxy.io",
        "port": 1080,
        "username": "username",       // (optional) Proxy username
        "password": "password"        // (optional) Proxy password
    }
}
```
